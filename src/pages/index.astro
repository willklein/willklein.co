			<h1>üëãüèΩ Hi friend! I'm Will.</h1>
			<p>
				I'm currently a design systems developer advocate learning to
				work with ADHD while juggling his three children. He loves
				teaching other developers and helping them realise their
				potential by learning what they might consider intimidating. He
				is equally excited to learn what each person can teach him,
				about software development or the world we share. He is devoted
				to breaking down barriers and making our industry one accepting
				and supportive of all.
			</p>
			<p>Here are some things I've worked on:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Growing the <a
						href="https://reactdenver.com/"
						target="_blank">React Denver</a
					> community through monthly events
				</li>
				<li>
					Speaking at a few conferences like JSConf Iceland,
					<a
						href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMqZgUNkqgk&t=587s"
						target="_blank">CascadiaJS</a
					>, React Rally, and Nodevember
				</li>
				<li>Writing modern JavaScript since 2011</li>
				<li>
					Encouraging others to give their first meetup or conference
					talk
				</li>
				<li>
					A <a

						target="_blank">browser extension</a
					> to add a table of contents to GitHub READMEs releases six years
					before they finally implemented it
				</li>
				<li>A bunch of ESLint rules</li>
				<li>
					Teaching people how to write their first JavaScript tool
					through talks, workshops, and a little website: <a
						href="https://astsareawesome.com/"
						target="_blank"
						>astsareawesome.com<a></a>
					</a>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				This was built with <a
					href="https://astro.build/"
					target="_blank">Astro</a
				>, deployed with <a
					href="https://www.netlify.com/"
					target="_blank">Netlify</a
				>, and probably edited on <a
					href="https://codesandbox.io/"
					target="_blank">CodeSandbox</a
				>.
